In a model based MP a stock assessment model is used to derive stock status relative to reference points, and then based on the status of the stock a TAC is set. For example using a hockey stick HCR,


Reference points imply a Harvest Control Rule (HCR) since a limit requires you to do something once it is breached and a target is a reward 
that you achieving something good. The standard fisheries HCR is a hockey stick function \ref{fig:hcr} where for any biomass a corresponding fishing mortality
is given. The hockey stick is defined by two points, the target and the limit.  The target point defines the constant level of F that management
seeks to achieve once biomass is greater than a certain value (i.e. the target biomass). Below that target biomass F declines linearly to the limit biomass, 
below which F is equal to the limit F.

Therefore defining targets and limits requires deciding upon the values used to define these two points. 

\section{Reference Points}


Since we are using a biomass dynamic model the operational analytical reference points are either MSY, BMSY, FMSY, K or r (i.e. the maximum reproductive rate which also gives you FCrash).
To use these we can either chose a multipler (i.e. LRP = BMSY*.7) or a PDF (i.e. LRP = 25th percentile of BMSY). 

We could also use a relative value, e.g. say in 2000 we though the stock was at BMSY then why not use that as a proxy for the LRP 
(e.g. as ICES did when originally defining a limit biomass based on MBAL).

Since the limits and targets are defined by F and biomass an important question is do biomass reference points perform beter than and harvest rate based ones
either as limits or targets. How do relative reference points perform realtive to absolute ones and do analytical reference points (e.g. BMSY based on 
parameters estimates from a model) perform better than relative ones based on historical values (e.g. a level of F which supported the highest observed catches).

\section{Evaluation}

%The MSE allows the the outcomes to be evaluated using performance statistics, i.e. the best LRP is the one that performs the best.

Howver the performance statistics do not have equal weight for all stakeholders., e.g. industry may give more to short-term yield, 
while conservationist may give more weight to suststainability. It is therefore important to calculate a range of statistics and then to 
explore the trade-offs between them.


The biomass of a stock next year ($B_{t+1}$) is equal to the biomass this year $B_{t}$, less the catch ($C_t$) plus the surplus production ($P_t$) i.e. 

\begin{equation}  B_{t+1}=B_{t}-C_{t}+P_{t}\end{equation}  

$P$ is given by the Pella-Tomlinson surplus production function \citep{pella1969generalized}

\begin{equation}\frac{r}{p}\cdot~B(1-(\frac{B}{K})^p)\end{equation}
